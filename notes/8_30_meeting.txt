What to discuss:
    findings about request density - what are we actually concerned about and steps to reduce concerns
    how to handle landing times? TTL

ttl is random

so...
some things I still need to fix:
    ports are not working properly
    limiting the number of requests per vertihub is also done crudely
    prints are not working? - make it so that prints don't happen unless they are not empty
